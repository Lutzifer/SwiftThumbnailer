# Thumbnail Grid Generator

This is a Swift command-line tool to generate beautiful thumbnail grids for video files. 
It takes one or multiple video files as input and produces `.jpg` images displaying evenly spaced thumbnails across each video's duration.

---

## Features

- **Multiple video support**: Provide as many video files as you want.
- **Customizable grid layout**: Set number of rows and columns.
- **Flexible image width**: Specify output width.
- **Human-readable timestamps**: Each thumbnail is labeled with its time.
- **Header Information**: Displays filename and duration at the top of the image.

## Usage

```bash
swift run thumbnailer <movie-file> [movie-file2 ...] [--rows=N] [--columns=N] [--width=N]
```

### Example

```bash
swift run thumbnailer sample1.mp4 sample2.mov --rows=3 --columns=5 --width=1920
```

This will create `sample1.mp4.jpg` and `sample2.mov.jpg` with 3 rows, 5 columns, and a width of 1920 pixels.

## Development Details

**Prompt that originated this tool:**
> Write a Swift command-line tool that:
> - Takes a movie file as input.
> - Accepts optional parameters: rows (default: 8), columns (default: 2), width (default: 1024).
> - Generates an image with the specified width.
> - Adds a header at the top showing file information: duration, filename, etc.
> - Creates a grid (rows Ã— columns) of thumbnails, spaced over the movie's duration.
> - Saves the resulting image with `.jpg` appended.

**Note**: Parts of this code (especially parts related to structuring the output, header formatting, and timestamp handling) were autogenerated with the help of AI tools, and then refined and enhanced manually.
